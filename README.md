# treehouse-fsjs-project5-employee-directory - Use a Public API to Create an Employee Directory

## Use a Public API to Create an Employee Directory

**Get and display 12 random users from The Random User Generator API:**

- [x] Using photos and information that the API provides, you’ll display 12 users, along with some basic information:
- [x] Image
- [x] First and Last Name
- [x] Email
- [x] City or location

**Create a modal window that will pop up when any part of the user’s row is clicked. The following details should display in the modal window:**

- [x] Image
- [x] Name
- [x] Username
- [x] Email
- [x] Cell Number
- [x] Detailed Address, including street name and number, city, state and/or country and post code.
- [x] Birthdate

**Structure and style the user directory so that it roughly matches the provide mockup.**

- [x] Display the users in a grid or table
- [x] Add a hover state to the rows of the user table.
- [x] Make sure there’s a way to close the modal window

## EXTRA CREDIT

- **[x] Add a way to filter the directory by name or username. To do this, you’ll need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. Note: you don't have to rely on the API to return search results. You'll need to write functionality that filters results once they already on the page.**

- **[x] Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.**
